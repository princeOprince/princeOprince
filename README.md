### Howdy mate! ðŸ‘‹

Prince O Prince is the name, Front End Development is the game, Android Development is the aim and UI design, well that's just the flair.

I love figuring out the solutions to problems using whatever tools are at my disposal. Most times I get it right, sometimes I don't and other times, I simply give it a rest but there is always an uneasiness whenever I'm unable to figure something out.
